SmoothWebView
=============

Small web view which does everything you would expect from a desktop widget:

- If you click on real links taking you to a new location, your browser is
  opened
- It has an auto-refresh option, but does not "twitch" during update as
  the stock web browser plasmoid does
- You can simply invert the colors to blend the website in (e.g. google
  calendar)
- When the mouse is inside the plasmoid, auto-refresh is turned off
